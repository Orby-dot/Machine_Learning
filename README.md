Ok so there is like a 50/50 chance you don't even read this but I'll give it a go

# Installation
In this directory there is a text file called `requirements.txt`. This is where we will put any packages that we use within this project.

## Installing packages
While you are within this directory paste this into the terminal: 
```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

Thats it. I swear if you mess the installation up I will lose it. 

# Testing
Testing is super easy but incase you don't know how to run a python script here is the basic format:

```$ python -m NAME_OF_FILE_HERE ARG ARGS MORE_ARGS ```

I will have seperate README's for each of our projects and each file will have a description on what they do. I will also add a `-h` command with every file so we can quickly check how to use them and what they do

# Background Info 
There is a sub directory called `Background info`, it will hold useful links to videos and webpages as well as some textbooks. If you get confused on what we are doing I recommend you check the resources in that directory before you go and DM me at 1am.
